# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
## Goal:
Our group project focuses on creating and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the
prices of secondhand cars. To achieve this, we've gathered a comprehensive dataset tailored for tasks
like price prediction, data analysis, and model development.
It's important to understand that this dataset captures a specific moment in time, giving us a
snapshot of used car listings available at that time. While it's a valuable resource for our goal, there
may be missing information and some small inconsistencies. To make sure our dataset is suitable for
our research and modeling work, we're starting our project by careful pre-processing followed by data
analysis and visualization.

## Data Source: 
We believe that this dataset can benefit the wider data science community by advancing our
understanding of automotive pricing models. Our primary goal is to use machine learning techniques
to build a model that can estimate the prices of older cars accurately. In doing so, we hope to provide
practical insights and tools that can assist both buyers and sellers in making better-informed decisions
in the used car market, ultimately enhancing our collective knowledge of this industry.
The dataset we will be using for the project is a public dataset available in Kaggle.

The dataset contains a variety of attributes, encompassing details such as the car's brand, model,
production year, mileage, engine specifications, fuel type, and numerous other factors. The dataset was
obtained through web scraping from cars.com, a well-recognized online platform dedicated to
facilitating the trade of pre-owned vehicles. The web scraping process involved the extraction of
comprehensive information from a diverse range of car listings, covering essential features like the
car's brand, model, production year, mileage, engine specifications, and more. It's important to
highlight that this dataset represents a specific moment in time, providing us with a snapshot of the
used car listings available on the platform during that particular period.

## Research Questions:
Q1. How effectively we can develop an accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices
based on the available features, and what is the optimal algorithm and feature selection approach to
achieve this?
Q2. Which features have the most significant impact on the price of a used car? Can we identify the
key features that influence car pricing decisions the most?
Q3. Can data preprocessing techniques, such as transformation, standardization, or normalization,
enhance the prediction performance of machine learning models? What evaluation metrics should be
used to assess the performance of the price prediction models?
Q4. To what extent do the models built on this dataset generalize to new, unseen data?
